        <h2>Phase 1: Grasshopper Building</h2>
        <p>I set out to build a basic flower shape with editable parameters that would allow me to scale the flower proportionally, adjust the petal dynamics independently, change the material thickness, and change the number/location of tabs if necessary. The images below go through the elements of the build, with the corresponding grasshopper parameters. </p>

              The Flower Proportion value directly influences the radii of the petals, the position of the petals, the radius of the inner circle,  the length of the slots, and the position of the slots.

      <!-- Phase 2: Flower variation testing  -->
      <div class="contentBlock">
      <h2>Phase 2: Flower variation testing</h2>
      <p>I planned to cut and test two variations of flowers with variations of petals and slots. Both variants (V1 and V2) had issues fitting together due to the orientation of the corrugation (again!) and the stability of the remaining petal material. I tried a variation with a wider petal (V3) and encountered the same issues.</p>
      <p> I decided to just add a “tab” to two points on the flower in order to stabilize the slot (V4). It is not the prettiest solution, but it was relatively easy to add in grasshopper and it worked. </p>

        <h2>Phase 3: Assembly & Learning Notes</h2>
        <p>I started assembling the parts randomly, but quickly realized this was unstable and I needed to align the N/S slots with the E/W petals of other flowers. I stuck to this pattern but added a few random daisies for flair at the end. </p>

        <h3>Learning 1: Slots? </h3>
        <p>Slots are so hard! I originally intended to slot slots in to other slots, but this proved too challenging and I focused on slot + surface joints. I think the fillet method and a wider slot opening coupled with a narrow end point would make this work better, but I didn’t have time to test in this round. I think this is also pronounced with cardboard which is so flexible. </p>

        <h3>Learning 2: Cut order</h3>
        <p>I noticed that when I exported a 2d vector from rhino to illustrator, the order of the layers always seemed to be random – maybe determined by the “order” they are baked in. It didn’t cause any problems but it was funny to watch the laser cutter jump around, and I imagine this could cause issues with some materials and more delicate cutting. </p>

        <h3>Shoutouts</h3>
        <p>Shoutout to Flo who helped me work through some grasshopper and printer issues! Thanks for being my double-checker and troubleshooter! </p>
