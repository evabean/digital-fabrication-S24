          My original plan was to build a vessel-type structure with rotational
          symmetry of 30 “waves” held together by two “suns”. I drew a quick
          sketch to visualize what components I would need and to make sure I
          would meet the assignment requirements (30 repeated identical pieces
          with slot fits that pass a shape test). I opted to do my design in
          illustrator because that's where I can work quickly – I'll learn Rhino
          next week, I think!

        <h2>Phase 2: Excited about thick cardboard</h2>
        <p>
          I was very excited when I acquired some sturdy corrugated cardboard
          for my A1 project. I managed to preserve a nice amount of ~7.5mm thick
          cardboard from a table saw box with the intention of using it to build
          my A1 project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took some measurements of the cardboard. I knew it wouldn't be
          perfect, because some of the cardboard was squashed in the journey,
          but I hoped it was close enough. I selected the least visibly squished
          pieces and used the calipers to take some measurements. The results
          were... mixed!

            I'm still practicing measuring, and I'm sure that had something to
            do with it, but I measured a range of thicknesses from 7.47mm to
            7.7mm. I also noticed the thickest measurement was on the edge
            running parallel to the corrugated ridges, and I wondered if I would
            see a lot of difference between different edges.

        <h2>Phase 3: Cut tests and not exited about thick cardboard</h2>
        <p>
          To test that theory, and play with how kerf works, I made a template
          that starts at the widest cardboard size I measured and moves down in
          .05mm increments (there was a lot of variance on "the internet forums"
          about kerf for cardboard, but not a lot of consensus, so I tried to
          cover a range knowing I might have to increase or decrease my variance
          scale). I planned to cut two versions of it, just to see how
          consistent the same cuts at two different times would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cardboard is pretty thick, and I couldn't find any specs online
          for settings to cut through. I tried a few test cuts with varying
          speed/power/frequency until I found one that cut through without too
          much burn. The winning combination was 5% speed, 100% power, and 80%
          frequency.However, when I went to cut my kerf test template at this
          setting, my cardboard started flaming a little too much for my
          comfort. It was time to abandon the thick cardboard.

        <p>
          A classmate was kind enough to give me her leftover thin cardboard, so
          I measured it and then set to work doing some new test cuts. I started
          with the cardboard settings recommended on the materials sheet above
          the printers, and tweaked until I got a good cut with little burn. I
          found that sometimes 20s/50p/50f worked and other times it didn’t – my
          final working cut was 20s/50p/50f but with a second pass of the laser, on
          the advice of the nice man at the front desk.

          With my cut width dialed in, I mass-cut 30-something waves and six
          suns. I made a few extra each in case I encountered issues assembling.
          I had started with the 20s/50p/50f double cuts, but I experimented again
          and found that 15s/60p/50f was a very reliable configuration for 2.5mm
          cardboard on the large laser printer. I was able to lift the “sun”
          right off the printer without any catching.

      <!-- What I learned -->
      <div class="contentBlock">
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <h3>About speed, power, and frequency on cardboard</h3>
        <p>
          In my experiments, it seemed like speed had the most impact on
          cardboard burn ability, in that order. When I dialed the speed down to
          5-10% to cut through the thick cardboard, it was visibly smokier and
          flamier than cuts above 50% speed. The high power was able to cut
          through the thick cardboard, but when I lowered it to around 50% on my
          second set of tests, the cuts were much cleaner and less burnt.
        </p>
        <h3>About kerf</h3>
        <p>
          My original kerf test had .05mm increments, and on the few I was able
          to test, they were all way too big to get a tight fit. I scaled it up
          to .1mm increments and started .5mm lower than the measured thickness
          for the thinner cardboard and had much better luck. I feel like I have
          a good sense of tolerance for two-ply cardboard now, but am curious to
          see other peoples’ results for different thicknesses and plys.

        </div>
        <h3>About coruggation and weak spots</h3>
        <p>
          When I went to go assemble the piece I discovered that putting in
          multiple pieces beside each other would “squish” the tab and leave
          less room for the adjacent piece. It got pretty tight as I went on,
          and I ended up pinching the edges of the cardboard to slot them in.
          The strongest spots seemed to have diagonal corrugation support, and
          the weakest had corrugation running across horizontally. This is a fun
          corrugation specific problem, in my estimate!
